This is a custom ARM template for F5 BIG-IP that deploys a cluster of BIG-IPs in Active/Standby mode using CFE in IPV6/IPV4 Dual Stack mode.

No functional tests have been performed yet regarding neither BIG-IP dual stack handling nor CFE failover.

This template is still Work in Progress and is not supported by F5.
